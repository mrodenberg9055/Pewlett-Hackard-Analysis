# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose
### Overview
- The purpose of this analysis is to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for the future as a large number of thier workforce is entering the retirement age.  We have been tasked with figuring out who all is eligible to retire, how many jobs will be left open, and what types of positions those vacancies will leave. In the midst of doing this analysis it has also been determined that we need to upgrade the methods used by Pewlett Hackard to track employee data from using Excel and VBA to using a SQL database to track these employee updates. 

## Results
### Key Takeaways
- PH has a little over 90k employees who meet the criteria to retire in the upcoming months, which equates to about 30% of their working staff. 
- Of the 90k employees eligible to retire over 60% of those employees hold a senior or manager title.
- Half of the employees that are reaching retirement age are engineers, we would need to be sure that our engineering staff is equiped to handle that type of departure. 
- Right now there are about 150k engineers in the company, about 45k of those are set to retire which is about 30% of that workforce
